## Getting Started (EXPAND on this)
These instructions will guide you on how to set up ClearSpeak on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## AI Model
ClearSpeak currently employs GPT-3.5-turbo for text rewriting but plans to upgrade to GPT-4 Turbo once the API key is accessible to improve performance and capabilities.

## Why GPT-4 Turbo?
GPT-4 Turbo surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo in reliability, creativity, and complex instruction handling. Excelling at tasks like problem-solving, multiple-choice questions, and aiding under-resourced languages, GPT-4 will optimize ClearSpeak's text rewriting for enhanced precision and creativity.
