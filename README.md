# ClearSpeak

## Design 

ClearSpeak is an application featuring a user-friendly graphical interface that enables users to translate job-specific jargon into language that is easily understandable for individuals not familiar with such terminology, benefiting both customers and colleagues from other departments.

## Features

- Convert work-related technical text into language understandable for everyone
- Useful for for multiple industries and departments
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Ability to choose three different modes: creative, natural and precise.

## What to implement (CHANGE to something more suitable once implemented)

In the application, implement a feature that allows users to rewrite text points in three different styles:

- Creative language for all audiences
- Easy-to-understand natural language
- Clear and precise language for everyone

For each point, the user should be able to convert it into the desired style. Below are examples of how to transform the given points:

## Getting Started (EXPAND on this)

These instructions will guide you on how to set up ClearSpeak on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## AI Model
ClearSpeak will utilizes the GPT-3.5-turbo model to perform text rewriting tasks. However, my intention is to switch to the GPT-4 Turbo model (once API key is available) for improved performance and capabilities.

### Why switch to GPT-4 Turbo?

GPT-4 Turbo performs better than GPT-3.5-turbo in areas like dependability, inventiveness, and managing detailed instructions. GPT-4 excels at various tasks, such as solving problems, answering multiple-choice questions, and helping with languages that have limited resources. This makes GPT-4 a perfect fit for the ClearSpeak app, as it will improve the text rewriting process and deliver more accurate and imaginative results.
