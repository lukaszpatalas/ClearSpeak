# Clear Speak

## Code Adaptation and Improvements:
- Modified code for custom requirements and upgraded to GPT-3.5-turbo.
- Focusing on prompt engineering and model parameter optimization.
- Promising initial results, with more improvements anticipated.

## Design
Clear Speak simplifies technical language in emails, documentation, and other materials, making it more accessible for customers and colleagues. Its user-friendly interface will offer natural and creative modes.

## Features
- Converts technical texts into understandable language.
- Applicable to various industries and materials.
- Two modes: natural and creative.
## Tasks to do
- Investigate AI-generated images (DALEE, MidJourney) and app development.
- Refine modes and test prompt suggestions.
- Enhance prompt engineering for clear output.
- Review the linked article for ideas and write benefits of clear communication.
- Finalize README.md and explore Azure deployment.
- Consider Power Apps and additional features.

## Extra ideas to explore
- Multi-language translation
- Speech-to-text (Whisper)

- Cloud storage and syncing

## Getting Started (EXPAND on this)
These instructions will guide you on how to set up Clear Speak on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## AI Model
Clear Speak currently uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for text rewriting tasks. However, our goal is to upgrade to the GPT-4 Turbo model (once the API key becomes available) to enhance performance and capabilities.

### Why upgrade to GPT-4 Turbo?
GPT-4 Turbo outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in aspects such as reliability, creativity, and handling complex instructions. GPT-4 is great at various tasks, like solving problems, answering multiple-choice questions, and assisting with languages that don't have many resources. This makes GPT-4 an ideal choice for the Clear Speak app, as it will optimize the text rewriting process and produce more precise and creative outcomes.
