# ClearSpeak

## Code Adaptation and Improvements:
- Modified code for custom requirements and upgraded to GPT-3.5-turbo.
- Focusing on prompt engineering and model parameter optimization.
- Promising initial results, with more improvements anticipated.

## Design
ClearSpeak simplifies technical language in emails, documentation, and other materials, making it more accessible for customers and colleagues. Its user-friendly interface will offer natural and creative modes.

## Features
- Converts technical texts into understandable language.
- Applicable to various industries and materials.
- Two modes: natural and creative.
## Tasks to do
- Investigate AI-generated images (DALEE, MidJourney) and app development.
- Refine modes and test prompt suggestions.
- Enhance prompt engineering for clear output.
- Review the linked article for ideas and write benefits of clear communication.
- Finalize README.md and explore Azure deployment.
- Consider Power Apps and additional features.

## Extra ideas to explore
- Multi-language translation
- Speech-to-text (Whisper)
- Instant messaging integration
- Machine learning suggestions
- Cloud storage and syncing

## Example

| Type      | Text                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original  | The exclusion criteria considered are: The metadata provides sufficient evidence that the study is not related to web development or engineering methodologies. The summary does not provide sufficient information or evidence to indicate that the research does not have an approach related to web application development methodologies. |
| Natural   | We have specific criteria for determining which studies are relevant to our research on web development and engineering methodologies. We base our decisions on information provided in the study's metadata and summary. If the metadata shows that the study is not related to web development or engineering methodologies, or if the summary does not provide enough information to determine whether the research is related to web application development methodologies, then we exclude it from our analysis.         |
| Creative  | Studies that don't fit our criteria are like a puzzle piece that doesn't quite match - their metadata doesn't reveal a connection to web development, or their summary doesn't provide enough clues to show that they use the same methods we're studying. |

## Getting Started (EXPAND on this)
These instructions will guide you on how to set up ClearSpeak on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## AI Model
ClearSpeak currently uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for text rewriting tasks. However, our goal is to upgrade to the GPT-4 Turbo model (once the API key becomes available) to enhance performance and capabilities.

### Why upgrade to GPT-4 Turbo?
GPT-4 Turbo outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo in aspects such as reliability, creativity, and handling complex instructions. GPT-4 is great at various tasks, like solving problems, answering multiple-choice questions, and assisting with languages that don't have many resources. This makes GPT-4 an ideal choice for the ClearSpeak app, as it will optimize the text rewriting process and produce more precise and creative outcomes.
